### Implemented Endpoints ✅

```
GET /competitions                              # Get all competitions
GET /competition/{competitionFifaId}/teams     # Get teams for competition
GET /competition/{competitionFifaId}/matches   # Get matches for competition

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Sync Players** (for top scorer FK integrity):
   - Call `/team/{teamFifaId}/players` for each team
   - Call `/competition/{competitionFifaId}/{teamFifaId}/players`

2. **Sync Top Scorers** (once players exist):
   - Will populate with real data from API

3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Sync player statistics from match events
   - Sync officials (coaches, referees)
   - Sync disciplinary cases
   - Historical data imports
